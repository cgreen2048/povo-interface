The COMPOSABLES folder provides functions that give individual Vue components (controllers) access to functions that store/grab data. 
We structure it this way to hide the actual implementation of gathering data (via mock, HTTP, or Supabase) and just give components the functions they need.

Why use composables when we can just grab the functions from the repos?
- Composables handle the REACTIVE STATE of items relevant to the composable. The repos should be stateless, while composables directly handle the current state of the app
- We can include refs, objects, etc. to be returned along with the functions to continue to abstract away especially since repos should not have Vue dependency (they're ts)

Defining question: how does the app use data?
