The DATA folder holds all applications of data management for front end composables to use. 
Here, we implement an interface to pass functions to the frontend composables and then implementations of those interfaces for each version.
These individual implementations define their versions of the functions, gathering and posting data from/to different places based on their implementation.

In short, this folder is how we actually ACCESS DATA IN THE FRONTEND

Defining question: how does the app access data?
